# ASD — Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains a collection of essential algorithms and data structures commonly used in computer science and technical interviews.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to gather well-known and optimized solutions to classic algorithmic problems in one place. The repository can be used as a learning resource, a reference for implementations, and as support when preparing for technical interviews (including Big Tech interviews).

## Scope
The project includes, but is not limited to:
- data structures (e.g. lists, stacks, queues, heaps),
- sorting and searching algorithms,
- classic algorithmic techniques,
- examples with time and space complexity analysis.

Some algorithms are implemented not only in Python, but also in **TypeScript**, allowing comparison between different languages and paradigms.

## Technologies
- Python 3  
- TypeScript

## Running the Code
To run the examples, the following tools are required:
- Python version 3.x
- Node.js (for TypeScript examples)

Examples:
```bash
python3 example.py
